  tips: `Tips for Playing Cyclops

1. Master the Scan Ability
Use Cyclops’s scan ability to scout ahead and reveal enemy positions. This gives your team a strategic advantage by preventing ambushes and allowing better positioning.

2. Shotgun Usage
Rely on his shotgun for close to medium-range combat, where it’s most effective. Keep in mind its limited range — avoid engaging long-distance targets unless necessary.

3. Use Cover Wisely
Stay close to walls and corners to safely peek and shoot. This tactic increases your shotgun’s effectiveness while minimizing exposure to enemy fire.

4. Healing on the Move
Activate his heal ability while running to maintain mobility and maximize survivability during heated fights or when retreating.

5. Secure the First Shot
Aim to land the first shot in any encounter. This early damage can tip the fight in your favor and often force enemies to retreat or lose accuracy.`,};
