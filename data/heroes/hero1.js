  tips: `Tips to Master Sparkle

1. Health and Reload Speed
Prioritize gear that boosts Sparkle’s health and reload speed, especially if you don’t have her personal gear yet. These stats greatly improve her survivability and combat efficiency.

2. Healing Advantage
Activate Sparkle’s healing ability early in a match to gain an instant armor boost. This saves precious time you’d otherwise spend looking for armor pickups.

3. Smart Grenade Usage
Avoid throwing grenades in close-quarters combat. They can easily backfire and cause damage to yourself or teammates — use them from a safe distance instead.

4. Positioning and Movement
Stay close to walls and cover to protect yourself from enemy fire. When possible, flank enemies to take them by surprise.

5. Gear Recommendations
Before unlocking Sparkle’s personal gear, aim for a balanced setup that includes Reload Speed, Movement Speed, HP, and Vision gear. This combination keeps you agile and durable on the battlefield.

6. Practice Makes Perfect
Use King of the Hill mode to practice Sparkle’s abilities. It’s an excellent way to master her mechanics and learn efficient timing for her skills.

7. Know When to Retreat
If you’re caught in point-blank encounters or rushed unexpectedly, don’t hesitate to fall back and find cover. Staying alive is often more important than finishing a risky fight.`,
