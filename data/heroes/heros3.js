  tips: `Tips for Playing Hurricane

1. Shield Discipline
Use the shield to block enemy fire while advancing or repositioning. Avoid charging directly into enemies — maintain a safe distance to maximize protection and control the pace of the fight.

2. Pistol Mastery
The pistol excels in close-range combat. Switch to it when enemies get too close, when your primary weapon runs out of ammo, or when you need a quick burst of damage.

3. Gear Optimization
Common Gear: Choose Thug Knuckle for increased damage or White Index Collar for higher fire rate and movement speed.
Personal Gear: Focus on increased health, reduced recoil, and improved vision to enhance shield usage and survivability.

4. Optimal Playstyle
Engage in close-quarters combat where the shield and pistol are most effective.
Use the shield to close the gap on ranged heroes or to defend against ambushes.
Always be aware of your surroundings and avoid getting caught in open areas where you’re exposed.
