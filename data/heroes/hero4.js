  tips: `Tips for Playing Molly

1. Ambush and Disarm Mastery
Molly excels at burrowing underground to ambush enemies. While underground, detect footsteps, then resurface to disarm foes in an area — her core strength for disrupting fights.

2. Vision and Footstep Tracking
Use underground vision to spot enemy footsteps from afar. This lets you track movements precisely and set up perfectly timed ambushes.

3. Escape and Scouting
Burrow to escape danger or scout ahead safely. It provides crucial intel on enemy positions without exposing yourself.

4. Gear Recommendations
Protective Glasses: Boosts vision range for earlier footstep detection.
Infantry Test: Increases health for better survivability in close calls.
Reflex Implant: Reduces firing spread, ideal for aggressive playstyles.

5. Strategic Ability Timing
Time burrowing for maximum impact — ambush, disarm, or flee. Watch the cooldown and surface carefully to avoid vulnerability.
