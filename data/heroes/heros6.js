  tips: `Tips for Playing Alice 🧛‍♀️

1. Portal Combo Mastery
Shoot a portal dart at an enemy, activate to blink on top, immediately use your slow skill, then unload primary fire while your passive heals you. This classic combo maximizes surprise and sustain.

2. Core Portal Strategies
Flank & Chase: Use portals to quickly flank, pursue weak enemies, or escape.
Speed & Damage Reduction: Exiting a portal grants 40% speed boost + 30% damage reduction — combine with health stims for godlike mobility.
Slow Enemies: Fire darts at ground/obstacles to create slowing energy fields that lock down targets for easy kills.
Team Utility: Place portals for fast map navigation or to cover blind spots.

3. Gear & Playstyle Essentials
Map Awareness: Learn layouts, spawns, and chokepoints for perfect portal timing.
Prioritize Accuracy: Speed matters, but consistent shots win fights faster.
Aggressive Mid-Range: Excel at close-mid fights — initiate with advantage, sustain via passive healing.
Rhythm Talent: Boosts nearby allies' recharge, damage, and stealth — coordinate team plays.

4. Survival & Game Sense
Smart Retreats: Despite high regen/mobility, Alice is squishy. Portal out when swarmed or losing.
Avoid Predictability: Don't run mindlessly — use environment, choose engagements wisely to prevent flanks.`,
