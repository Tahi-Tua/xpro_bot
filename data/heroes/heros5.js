  tips: `Tips for Playing Satoshi

1. Shield Mastery
Learn efficient shield placements that cover multiple angles at once for maximum protection.
Master shield flicking to quickly deploy and reposition your shield during fights.
Exploit the shield range boost to control space and block enemy fire from unexpected directions.

2. Game Sense Essentials
Avoid open spaces: Always move around corners. Hover your finger over the shield button in exposed areas — your survival depends on it against aggressive heroes like Mirage.
Team Support: Time your team heal perfectly to keep allies alive during key moments.
Deploy the heal drone on Satoshi himself for sustained pressure in fights.

3. Combat Fundamentals
Master Satoshi's firing pattern to land consistent damage.
Equip a strong gearset that complements his shield and healing playstyle (focus on health, reload, and utility).
